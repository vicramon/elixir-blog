          <h1>The Rebel Force</h1>
          <p>Don&rsquo;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&rsquo;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Red Five standing by. But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Don&rsquo;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&rsquo;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
          <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don&rsquo;t trust them. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. What good is a reward if you ain&rsquo;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&rsquo;t my idea of courage. It&rsquo;s more like&hellip;suicide. But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Ye-ha!</p>
          <ul>
          <li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li>
          <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
          <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
          <li>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</li>
          <li>What?!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I&rsquo;m trying not to, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I find your lack of faith disturbing. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re best at, ain&rsquo;t it? I call it luck.</p>
          <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&rsquo;re going. But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
          <ol>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the Force.</li>
          <li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li>
          <li>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>
          <p>As you wish. Don&rsquo;t be too proud of this technological terror you&rsquo;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&rsquo;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
          <p>As you wish. Alderaan? I&rsquo;m not going to Alderaan. I&rsquo;ve got to go home. It&rsquo;s late, I&rsquo;m in for it as it is. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</p>
          <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Don&rsquo;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&rsquo;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Don&rsquo;t be too proud of this technological terror you&rsquo;ve constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. What?!</p>
          <p>I find your lack of faith disturbing. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. But with the blast shield down, I can&rsquo;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</p>
          <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can&rsquo;t possibly&hellip; Kid, I&rsquo;ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of strange stuff, but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything to make me believe there&rsquo;s one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There&rsquo;s no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It&rsquo;s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
          <p>As you wish. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
          <p>Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I&rsquo;m surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. What good is a reward if you ain&rsquo;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&rsquo;t my idea of courage. It&rsquo;s more like&hellip;suicide. Dantooine. They&rsquo;re on Dantooine.</p>
